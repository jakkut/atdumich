You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Dependencies
For those curious, we use:
- Next.js (front-end library)
- Sanity (content management system)
- Tailwind CSS (beautiful styling library)
- shadcn/ui (component ~library~ database?)
